    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 (20 ounce) package prepared macaroni and cheese, thawed if frozen
      </li>
      <li>1 slice American cheese, quartered</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>
      Preheat an electric smoker to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C), and add wood
      chips according to manufacturers’ directions. Use any wood chips that you
      would use for smoking meat.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>
      If prepared macaroni and cheese is not already in a heatproof dish, spoon
      it into a dish that can sit directly on the rack of a smoker. Divide
      cheese slices over the top.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>
      Place the dish directly on the rack of the smoker, and smoke until hot and
      bubbly, about 1 1/2 hours. Serve immediately.
